# Goals and Overview
Learning how to create a repo

The purpose of this repo is to learn how to create, edit, and update files in Github using the online tools.

The secondary goal is to learn whether syncing with local files on my main computer is desirable and possible.

A third goal is to capture thoughts on what I think I need to learn.

A fourth goal is to learn Github markdown specs.

Q: Will I be able to delete this if I need to later?
